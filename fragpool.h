/** @file
 * @mainpage Fragpool: Variable-sized packet memory management for embedded applications
 *
 * Fragpool is a memory management infrastructure designed to support
 * stream-to-packet layer interfaces in memory constrained devices.
 *
 * The use case is an embedded system which passes data between a
 * stream-oriented interface such as a UART and a packet-oriented
 * interface such as HDLC.  The expectation is that the final length
 * of a packet is not known at the point where stream reception
 * starts.  Consequently a system is obliged to allocate a large
 * buffer.  Once the packet is complete, the data must be passed to
 * another layer, and the space is not available for new packets that
 * are received while previous packets are being processed.
 *
 * fragpool's fp_request() function allocates a buffer given minimum
 * and maximum size.  fp_resize() and fp_reallocate() decrease or
 * increase the size of the reserved space, preserving initial
 * content.  fp_release() is ultimately invoked to return the buffer.
 * 
 * The memory available for allocation and the degree of fragmentation
 * supported are fixed for the life of the pool, normally at the time
 * the application is compiled.  Allocation will adjust
 * caller-provided sizes to maintain pool-defined alignment
 * constraints.
 *
 * All fragpool routines are non-blocking, and are intended to be
 * callable from hard interrupt context.  Protection against
 * re-entrancy must be supplied by the caller.
 *
 * This code is licensed under BSD-3-Clause.
