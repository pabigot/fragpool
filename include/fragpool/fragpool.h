 * @mainpage Fragpool: Variable-sized packet memory management for embedded applications
 *
 * Fragpool is a memory management infrastructure designed to support
 * stream-to-packet layer interfaces in memory constrained devices.
 *
 * The use case is an embedded system which passes data between a
 * stream-oriented interface such as a UART and a packet-oriented
 * interface such as HDLC.  The expectation is that the final length
 * of a packet is not known at the point where stream reception
 * starts.  Consequently a system is obliged to allocate a large
 * buffer.  Once the packet is complete, the data must be passed to
 * another layer, and the space is not available for new packets that
 * are received while previous packets are being processed.
 *
 * There are only a few functions, accessed by including
 * <fragpool/fragpool.h>:
 *
 * @li fp_request() allocates a buffer given the minimum acceptable
 * and maximum expected final sizes;
 *
 * @li fp_resize() and fp_reallocate() decrease or increase the size
 * of the reserved space, preserving initial content; they differ in
 * that fp_resize() is not permitted to move the buffer;
 *
 * @li fp_release() is ultimately invoked to return the buffer;
 *
 * @li fp_reset() clears the pool and fp_validate() checks it for
 * consistency.
 *
 * The memory available for allocation and the degree of fragmentation
 * supported are fixed for the life of the pool, normally at the time
 * the application is compiled.  Allocation will adjust
 * caller-provided sizes to maintain pool-defined alignment
 * constraints.
 *
 * @note All fragpool routines are non-blocking and are intended to be
 * callable from hard interrupt context.  Protection against
 * re-entrancy must be supplied by the caller.
